The global technology sector is poised for significant revenue growth in 2025, with projections consistently strong. Forrester anticipates global tech spending to hit $4.9 trillion with 5.6% growth, while Gartner is even more optimistic, forecasting around $5.75 trillion and a robust 9.3% increase. Key segments like data centers and software are expected to see double-digit expansion. Semiconductor sales are also set for a substantial boost, projected to reach $697 billion. Despite this positive outlook, macroeconomic uncertainty has led some, like UBS, to slightly temper earnings growth forecasts for tech companies, adjusting from 16% to 12%. Overall, the sector remains a powerhouse of innovation and investment.
