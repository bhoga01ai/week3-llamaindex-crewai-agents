Global IT spending is projected to reach between $5.43 trillion (Gartner) and $5.74 trillion, marking a significant increase of 7.9% to 9.3% from 2024. Key growth drivers include the IT Services market, poised for a US$1.50 trillion revenue surge in 2025. The software market is particularly robust, expected to grow over 10% annually through 2029, with both software and data center segments anticipating double-digit growth in 2025.
